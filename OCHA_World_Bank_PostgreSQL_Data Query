# The first step was to download the data from the OCHA database 

https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-combined-indicators-for-uganda

# Once complete, I began to create the database in PostgreSQL

CREATE DATABASE "World Bank Uganda"
    WITH 
    OWNER = postgres
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
    
# I then moved to create the tables in PostgreSQL

# 1st table created
CREATE TABLE public."Indic"
(
    "Country Name" text,
    "Country ISO3" text,
    "Year" date,
    "Indicator Name" text,
    "Indicator Code" text,
    "Value" numeric,
    PRIMARY KEY ("Country Name")
);

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public."Indic"
    OWNER to postgres;
    
#2nd table created
CREATE TABLE public.qc_indicators_uga
(
    "Country ISO3" text,
    "Year" numeric,
    "Indicator Code" text,
    "Value" bigint
);

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.qc_indicators_uga
    OWNER to postgres;
    
# I then had to import the data to begin quering the data

Select * 
From "Indicators.uga"

Select * 
From "Indicators.uga"
Order by "Year"; 

# I then carried out some descriptive statistics on the data

Select distinct("Indicator_Name")
From "Indicators.uga"

Select min("Year")
From "Indicators.uga"

Select max("Year")
From "Indicators.uga"
